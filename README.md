Time Series Analysis with Stock Data
Overview:
This project involves the analysis of time series data from the stock market, focusing on multiple tech companies. I utilized Python and various data science libraries to explore, visualize, and derive insights from the historical stock prices.

Key Features:
Data Collection:
Gathered stock data for tech companies such as Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.

Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Cleaned and prepared the dataset, handling missing values and converting data types.

Visualization:
Plotted time series graphs to visualize the closing prices of different tech companies over time.
Implemented moving averages to identify trends and patterns.

Daily Returns Analysis:
Calculated daily percentage changes in closing prices to analyze the volatility of each stock.

Resampling Analysis:
Explored resampling techniques to analyze monthly, quarterly, and yearly trends in closing prices.

Correlation Analysis:
Investigated the correlation between the closing prices of different tech companies.
Explored the correlation between the daily percentage changes in stock prices.
Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas
NumPy
